I added a teaspoon of dried lemon zest, other than that I stuck to the recipe. Right before baking, I sprinkled a little sugar over each muffin mound. I did get 12 BIG muffins out of one recipe instead of one big loaf. Baked at 350*, my muffins were done at 23 minutes. VERY good. My muffins didn't rise very much, next time I make this I would add a teaspoon of baking powder maybe.

The bread came out fluffy and moist! I tried it for the first time and it's excellent! I did somehow made these changes:1. 1 cup AP flour + 1 cup oat flour instead of 2 cups of AP flour.2. 1/2 cup of brown sugar + 1/4 cup of white sugar instead of 1 full cup of white sugar (still it came out very sweet so I suggested to reduce it even more.3. Added 1 spoon of whole fat milk4. Buttered 2 regular aluminum baking foil pans and dusted brown sugar + cinnamon powder at the bottom and at the top of the bread (highly recommended!)5. Coated the blueberries with flour so that it won't sink6. Added chopped walnuts for some crunch and 1 medium banana slices for topping decoration7. It definitely took over 45 minutes to bake it, I guess every oven is different.

I made it the way they called for the first time ...the second time I used 2 mini loafs and buttered them in stead of greasing . 2 eggs I put a mixture of cinnamon sugar on the sides of my rubber mini pans with flour on the bottom post buttering also I used 2 x blueberries wet then then dusted them in flour so not as many sank to the bottom, then I added 1/4 cup sour cream in a bowl with 1tsp baking soda mixing well let it sit till it foamed up some before mixing in at the same time as bananas gave it more moisture. Also added about 4 or 5 more tablespoons of sifted! flour to compensate for extra blueberries. On the top I cup up 1/2 inch thick slices of a regular banana spaced out across batter just barely sprinkled with cinnamon sugar looked great when it came out of the oven ...baked about 45min at 350 or until toothpick comes out clean came out awesome ....

I made it in a 9x5 loaf pan since I don’t have the minis.Added 2 tsps of baking powder, 2 tsps of cinnamon ( COVID killed my taste buds) a handful of walnut pieces, and 2 tsps of vanilla bean .2 tablespoons of flax seed meal.Cooked at 350 f for 1 hour. Perfect. Moist, flavorful for my jacked up tastebuds and quick to prepare. I did use parchment paper instead of greasing the pan. Personal preference.Will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Delicious. I made in a bundt pan (as another reviewer did) and I didn't have mini loaf pans.I had 3 ripe bananas I needed to use so added all 3 (approx 1 1/2 C). I added 1 t cinnamon and tossed blueberries in flour before folding in.I sprayed my bundt pan with Bakers Joy, then sprinkled with cinnamon sugar before adding batter. Baked for 55 minutes.

Doubled recipe. Made 2 9" loaves and a 2 muffins. I used half the blueberries and ground up a cup of frozen strawberries & used that. I was out of vanilla so added 2 tblspns maple syrup. I also added 1 tsp cinnamon.I did not this time but next time will use parchment paper on the bottom of the pans.I cooked for over an hour. It was about 1 hr 15 mins. I kept checking every five minutes after the hour. One loaf was done before the other.

My go-to starter recipe. And I mean that in a good way. This time I changed up the recipe only a bit. I creamed butter and sugar (half cane and half brown sugar) then added vanilla, big dash nutmeg and cinnamon, 4 bananas (I’ve used more in past), added dry ingredients last and as called for, I folded in the fruits, using 1 1/2 cup giant blueberries coated with flour and 1 cup walnuts. I buttered pans and used cane sugar instead of flour to coat over top of butter. Learned that from Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry in their British Baking show. While hot, loosen sides and remove to cool on rack. Comes out much easier than letting bread cool in pan and gives a nice outer crunch. Clean up is easier too. ;) Baked 15 minutes longer, reduced heat to 335 midway, and covered with foil once a bit browned (it continues to brown. Anyway, came out delicious!! Thanks for the recipe.

I doubled the recipe and also added some all spice. I did muffins and a loaf of bread. They both turned out delicious! I tossed my blueberries in flour before adding and they are perfectly distributed throughout. Thanks so much!

I baked it for 32 minutes using a Bundt pan and it was nice and moist. With a cup of sugar, it wasn’t too sweet, but it was perfect for me as I don’t like it very sweet. I also added some chopped walnuts and pecans before I baked it. It was delicious and it made my house smell good while it was baking.

I just tried this, it smells and looks delicious!!! I will say that I should have just made one large loaf of it with the batter because I tried 3 as stated in the recipe but I didn’t have enough batter. I went ahead and did 3 since I had already greased the pans and didn’t feel like cleaning them lol! This was my first time making anything like this, and I read the first step wrong lollllll so it’s my fault!! This recipe is super easy and straightforward. Thank you for sharing!!

Tasty, and great way to use up those sad bananas sitting on the counter. Makes 4 mini loaves, though I went heavy on the blueberries. freezes well. Easy recipe. Cut back a smidge on the sugar, and used both white and brown. Easy peasy.
